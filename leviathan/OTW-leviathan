overthewire leviathan solutions:

lvl 1 : rioGegei8m

lvl 2 : ougahZi8Ta (strace : traces system calls, very useful to check what a program is doing)

(ltrace: traces libraries calls, very useful as well).

lvl 3: Ahdiemoo1j (ln :used to make a symbolic link to a file)
the trick is to trick the program into showing the pass
other option is bash -p which forces the binary to hold the privilages

lvl 4: vuH0coox6m (nothing new)

lvl 5 : Tith4cokei (nothing new, pass was in binary)

lvl 6 : UgaoFee4li (again, using the linking method to force a program to do something to another file)

lvl 7 : ahy7MaeBo9 (used script to brute force 4 digit pin)

#!/bin/bash

for i in {0000..9999};do
	echo $i
	~/leviathan6 $i
done
